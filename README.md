# ML Exploration - Day 4

Welcome to the repository for Day 4 of my internship at BAT WEB SOLUTIONS! ðŸš€

## Overview

This repository documents my exploration into Supervised Machine Learning and the practical implementation of a Linear Regression model. The day's activities included understanding the fundamentals of supervised learning, comparing it with unsupervised learning, and hands-on experience with Linear Regression.

## Key Learnings

- **Supervised Machine Learning:**
  - Explored the foundational concepts and inner workings.
  - Compared supervised learning with unsupervised learning.

- **Linear Regression Model:**
  - Implemented a Linear Regression model from scratch.
  - Gained insights into predicting outcomes based on input variables.

## Folder Structure

- **Notebooks:** Contains Jupyter Notebooks used for coding exercises.
- **Screenshots:** Screenshots showcasing the Linear Regression model in action.
- **Resources:** Additional resources used for reference.

## Repository Contents

- [Day4_SupervisedML_Exploration.ipynb](./Notebooks/Day4_SupervisedML_Exploration.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook with code and explanations.
- [Screenshots](./Screenshots): Folder containing screenshots of the Linear Regression model.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ML-Exploration-Day4.git
   ```

2. Explore the Jupyter Notebook to understand the code and concepts.

3. Review the screenshots to visualize the Linear Regression model in action.
